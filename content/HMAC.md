HMAC stands for "Hash-based Message Authentication Code." It is a cryptographic algorithm used for message authentication, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data transmitted over a network. HMAC uses a secret key and a hash function to produce a fixed-size output, which is then appended to the message. The recipient can then use the same key and hash function to verify the integrity of the message by recomputing the HMAC and comparing it to the received value.
