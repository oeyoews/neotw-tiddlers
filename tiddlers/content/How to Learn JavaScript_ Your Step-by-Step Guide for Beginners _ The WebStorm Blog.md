## Learning principles

Learning new things can seem daunting and overwhelming. However, using a variety of learning techniques to enhance learning efficiency and effectiveness can help improve your odds of success.

**Good learning techniques:**

* **Take breaks:** Focused learning is hard – for every 25 minutes of study, take a five-minute break.
* **Regular revision:** After you finish learning a concept, take 30 seconds to try to recall all the main points.
* **Spaced repetition:** Come back to concepts every so often to reinforce them.
* **Build an association:** Linking the concepts to other subjects will help with recalling them. You can do this by using interesting code examples that resonate with you. 
* **Use multiple sources:** Different examples and explanations of a concept aid understanding.
* **Try and solve problems:** Apply what you’ve learned in real-life situations.
* **Get feedback:** Test your understanding – you’ll learn from getting it wrong.
* **Explain what you’ve learned:** Put what you’ve learned into your own words.
* **Learn before bedtime:** Your brain will continue to go over the information and cement it.

**Learning pitfalls:**

* **Don’t just look at the solution:** You have to go through the process of solving the problem yourself.
* **Don’t solve the same problems:** Once you know how to comfortably solve it, move on.
* **Don’t add distractions:** Study time should just be for studying. Focus.
* **Don’t study passively:** You need to be engaged, or it won’t stick.
* **Don’t think you’ll learn it in one go:** you won’t.

## Conclusion

That’s it for today! Learning something new is an infinitely rewarding pursuit. With the right attitude and resources, there’s nothing you can’t learn – it just takes time. If you’re frustrated that you can’t create the next Amazon or Netflix competitor after taking a four-hour course, don’t worry – we’ve all been there. The only way to get better is to practice and code: try, fail, learn, and repeat. You’ll get the biggest gains by applying the code, so even once you have been through a course and learned the basics, it’s time to start applying this knowledge. This is where you’re going to get good – actually, not good – great! 

Happy developing!
