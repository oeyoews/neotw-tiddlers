I don't know how many times I've tried, but it looks like I've finally succeeded.  

I've seen some people working on similar TiddlyWiki Electron projects before, but most of them didn't quite meet my expectations. Additionally, from various forum posts, I noticed that many people are often confused about TiddlyWiki's saving mechanism.  

So, I decided to create my own project to address these issues.  

I want this Electron app to be as simple as possible while also being beginner-friendly. If the user experience is good, I believe it can help more people understand and try out TiddlyWiki with ease.

我不知道这是我第几次尝试，看来我现在成功了。 我之前也看到一些人做过类似的tiddlywiki electron 项目, 但是大多不是很符合我的预期， 并且论坛的一些帖子， 我看到一些人常常困惑于tiddlywiki 的保存方式. 所以我决定自己做一个来解决这些问题， 我希望这个electron app 尽可能的简单， 同时尽可能地对新人比较友好， 如果体验比较好的话， 我认为这可以最大程度的方便人们了解tiddlywiki, 尝试tiddlywiki.
