        "text": "A [chance conversation](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWikiLinks/pull/58#issuecomment-1928118038) with [@bimlas](https://github.com/bimlas) here on GitHub a few days ago prompted me to wonder if we can bring about a virtual reunion of past TiddlyWiki contributors. 几天前在 GitHub 上与这里的一次偶然对话促使我想知道我们是否可以为过去的 TiddlyWiki 贡献者举办一次虚拟聚会。\n\nOver the years, many people have become highly valued and trusted contributors to the core. For different personal and professional reasons, inevitably sometimes people move on to other things. (Occasionally, people come back after an extended absence with renewed enthusiasm (and skills) to bring to bear on TiddlyWiki). 多年来，许多人已成为高度重视和值得信赖的核心贡献者。由于不同的个人和职业原因，有时人们不可避免地会转向其他事情。 （有时，人们在长时间缺席后会带着新的热情（和技能）回来，为 TiddlyWiki 带来影响）。\n\nThis year marks the [20th anniversary](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/tiddlywiki-is-19-years-old/8068) of the first release of TiddlyWiki which seems like a great opportunity to invite these past contributors to share some of their recollections. 今年是 TiddlyWiki 首次发布 20 周年，这似乎是邀请这些过去的贡献者分享他们的一些回忆的绝佳机会。\n\nIn a comment below I'll tag people who have made contributions to the core in the past, but haven't been active here or in the forums in the last twelve months. Do please reply here if I've missed anyone. 在下面的评论中，我将标记那些过去曾为核心做出贡献但在过去 12 个月内未在此处或论坛中活跃的人员。如果我错过了任何人，请在这里回复。\n\nIf you are one of these contributors, I first of all would like to say a heartfelt thank you. From my own perspective, these twenty years have been like working with a sparkling, intertwined river of talented people. You have devoted your time and attention to something that I care about immensely, and I couldn't be more privileged than to have fallen into this position. 如果您是这些贡献者之一，我首先要向您表示衷心的感谢。从我个人的角度来看，这二十年就像是与一条闪闪发光、交织在一起的人才河流一起工作。你把你的时间和注意力投入到了我非常关心的事情上，能够落到这个位置，我感到无比荣幸。\n\nThere are a few questions that might be fun if you felt like sharing. 如果您想分享的话，有几个问题可能会很有趣。\n\n* How are you doing? 你好吗？\n* Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？\n* Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？\n* Do you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki? 您在 TiddlyWiki 工作期间有什么最美好的回忆吗？\n\n[![@Telumire](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31185220?s=60\\&v=4)](https://github.com/Telumire)\n\n### How are you doing? 你好吗？\n\nMy mental health wasn't in the best place last year, I wasn't able to focus /work, but I'm doing better now. I hope everyone is doing well ! 去年我的心理健康状况不佳，我无法集中注意力 / 工作，但我现在做得更好了。我希望每个人都做得很好 ！\n\n### Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？\n\nYes ! I use it whenever I get the chance. I'm currently using it to gather my [research notes](https://designthinkerer.github.io/Scidelice/notes/notes%20TFE.html) for my bachelor thesis (it's a pwa aimed to help people to cook and eat well with science). I'm also using it to teach math (<https://learning-math.tiddlyhost.com/>), php (<https://learning-php-mysql.tiddlyhost.com/>), I created a [user guide for the steamdeck](https://steamdeckguide.tiddlyhost.com/), [a wiki](https://ifapme-dwfe.tiddlyhost.com/) for my classmates learning front end dev, and [many more](https://tiddlyhost.com/hub/user/Telumire). My biggest struggle with tiddlywiki is to complete a project before starting a new one, ahah. 是的 ！只要有机会我就会使用它。我目前正在用它来收集我的学士论文的研究笔记（这是一个 PWA，旨在帮助人们用科学来烹饪和饮食）。我还用它来教数学（https\\://learning-math.tiddlyhost.com/）、php（https\\://learning-php-mysql.tiddlyhost.com/），我为 steamdeck 创建了用户指南、我的同学学习前端开发的 wiki 等等。我在 tiddlywiki 中遇到的最大困难是在开始新项目之前先完成一个项目，哈哈。\n\n### Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？\n\nThe [latest annoncement](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/announcing-the-multiwikiserver-plugin/9033) (multi user wiki) is exactly what I was missing in tiddlywiki, so yes, absolutely! 最新的公告（多用户维基）正是我在 tiddlywiki 中所缺少的，所以是的，绝对！\n\n[![@grayeul](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4694124?s=60\\&v=4)](https://github.com/grayeul)\n\nI don't have a whole lot to add, and almost didn't reply -- but I figured I should at least take the time to say a very heartfelt thanks to [@Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) for all his hard work on TiddlyWiki. I had one very minor contribution, and while I kept wanting to get more time to help understand and document the behavior better, it never quite materialized. [@Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) made himself available for a one-on-one call and helped explain some of the codebase to me, which I really appreciated..... and I feel bad I never quite returned the favor by getting over the hump enough to really contribute. 我没有太多要补充的，而且几乎没有回复 —— 但我想我至少应该花时间对他在 TiddlyWiki 上的辛勤工作表示衷心的感谢。我做出了一项非常小的贡献，虽然我一直希望获得更多时间来帮助更好地理解和记录该行为，但它从未完全实现。他让自己可以进行一对一的通话，并帮助向我解释了一些代码库，我真的很感激…… 但我感到很遗憾，我从未通过克服困难来真正做出贡献来回报他的恩惠。\n\nWhile I don't necessarily use TiddlyWiki every day, I still use it quite a bit, and have convinced a few others of its benefit as well. I have some useful info archived in a couple of TWs that I return to, and update periodically. I have just recently retired from my day job, and now have a bit more time, and have started working on some other Open Source software. I still hope that at some point I can get more familiar with the guts of TW -- but I'm grateful I have been able to come back to it over and over again as a user. Thanks to all who helped make it what it is today! 虽然我不一定每天都使用 TiddlyWiki，但我仍然经常使用它，并且也让其他一些人相信了它的好处。我在几个 TW 中存档了一些有用的信息，我会定期返回并更新这些信息。我最近刚刚从日常工作中退休，现在有了更多的时间，并开始研究其他一些开源软件。我仍然希望在某个时候我可以更加熟悉 TW 的内部结构 —— 但我很感激我能够作为用户一次又一次地回到它。感谢所有帮助我们取得今天成就的人！\n\nHi Jeremy & thanks for the warm words. 你好，杰里米，谢谢你的热情话语。\n\nI can't exactly remember, when I came across TW but it must have been around the time when TW5 just came out. 我不太清楚我是什么时候接触到 TW 的，但肯定是在 TW5 刚出来的时候。\n\nI can remember that I tried to use it in a project at work, where I had to put together a big questionnaire. 我记得我尝试在工作项目中使用它，当时我必须整理一份大型调查问卷。\n\nI also used it for personal documentation stuff while i was working on a project. 当我在做一个项目时，我也用它来记录个人文档。\n\nWhen using TW extensively I noticed a few limitations which I worked around by implementing some extensions for TW and so landed up in contributing a bit. 当广泛使用 TW 时，我注意到一些限制，我通过实现 TW 的一些扩展来解决这些限制，因此最终做出了一些贡献。\n\nUnfortunately, for TW it is, not for me personally, my project and job completely changed in August 2019 and there was no real use anymore for TW in my work. I Just set up one small TW for noting down what to do if my colleague is on vacation and I have to take over a few of his tasks, but these are all not required anymore. 不幸的是，对于 TW 来说，对我个人来说不是，我的项目和工作在 2019 年 8 月完全改变了，TW 在我的工作中不再有真正的用处。我只是设置了一个小 TW，用于记录如果我的同事在度假而我必须接手他的一些任务时该怎么做，但这些都不再需要了。\n\nDuring Corona I couldn't follow one of my hobbies anymore: Dancing. Our dance classes were cancelled for a few months. But thanks to the owner of the dance school we got a lot of small video clips showing all the figures we learn in his classes. So the final project I did with TW5 was, to put together for my classmates a TW which lists all the clips related to our program, which I have on tiddlyhost. But unfortunately it wasn't used very much. 在新冠疫情期间，我无法再从事自己的一项爱好：跳舞。我们的舞蹈课被取消了几个月。但多亏了舞蹈学校的老板，我们得到了很多小视频剪辑，展示了我们在他的课堂上学到的所有舞蹈动作。所以我用 TW5 做的最后一个项目是，为我的同学整理一个 TW，其中列出了与我们的节目相关的所有剪辑，我在 tiddlyhost 上有这些剪辑。但不幸的是它并没有被太多使用。\n\nI have very fond memories of the time we had our Google Hangouts discussing some development with Jeremy and Mario. Unfortunately I think I won't be able to contribute any more because there are too many years of development I didn't follow. 我对我们在 Google Hangouts 上与 Jeremy 和 Mario 讨论一些开发的时光留下了非常美好的回忆。不幸的是，我认为我无法再做出更多贡献，因为我没有遵循太多年的发展。\n\nI still can remember that I always wanted to change the scripting part of TW because I find it to inconsistent, but I never had good alternatives. I think I thought about implementing something like LISP ([https://lisp-lang.org](https://lisp-lang.org/)) because I felt the scripting already has some resemblance to that, but I never found the time to elaborate on that. 我仍然记得我一直想更改 TW 的脚本部分，因为我发现它不一致，但我一直没有好的替代方案。我想我考虑过实现类似 LISP (https\\://lisp-lang.org) 的东西，因为我觉得脚本已经与它有一些相似之处，但我从来没有时间详细说明这一点。\n\nSo Happy 20th anniversary to TW and congratulations to Jeremy and all the developers for this great program. 祝 TW 20 周年快乐，祝贺 Jeremy 和所有开发这个伟大项目的人。\n\nBTW. [@Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) You remember my little son when we once met in London? He is the same age as TW, becoming 20 this year. 顺便提一句。你还记得我们在伦敦见面时我的小儿子吗？他和 TW 同岁，今年 20 岁了。\n\n[![@sukima](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70075?s=60\\&v=4)](https://github.com/sukima)\n\n## How are you doing? 你好吗？\n\nI'm doing well. It took a long time for me to fully utilize TiddlyWiki in my daily workflow but I've finally been using it daily for over 5 years consistently and I am so very glad it has been available for me. 我很好。我花了很长时间才在日常工作流程中充分利用 TiddlyWiki，但我终于每天都使用它超过 5 年了，我很高兴它对我来说是可用的。\n\nMany of my co-workers obsess over tools like Obsidian, Notion, etc. but I keep chugging along with TiddlyWiki every happy and shaking my head at others continuing to search for that elusive productivity tool. 我的许多同事都痴迷于 Obsidian、Notion 等工具，但我一直很高兴地继续使用 TiddlyWiki，并对其他人继续寻找这种难以捉摸的生产力工具摇摇头。\n\nI think it helps that I have a very strong skill set in Web technology. 我认为我在网络技术方面拥有很强的技能，这对我很有帮助。\n\n## Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？\n\nIt has, ever since I started making daily journal entries for work–usually just a list of ticket numbers and meetings attended–I am able to compile a year in review for my annual performance reviews. Because I settled on some consistent terminology in my tiddlers I was able to discover things like how many times I pair programmed or how many meetings I attended that year. Free form text search was very useful here. 自从我开始每天记录工作日记（通常只是票号和参加的会议的列表）以来，我就能够为我的年度绩效评估编制一年的回顾。因为我在我的 tiddlers 中确定了一些一致的术语，所以我能够发现一些事情，比如我那一年结对编程的次数或者我参加了多少次会议。自由形式文本搜索在这里非常有用。\n\nIn other projects I found that it was far easier and enjoyable to build documentation in disjointed ADHD like manor and have it all compiled into an interactive interface in a single HTML file. Being web based I could include all kinds of multimedia. I really enjoy that style of creativity. I am not a good organizer and TW lets me dump my brain and worry about organization after I've had a chance to marinate in my thoughts. 在其他项目中，我发现在像庄园这样脱节的 ADHD 中构建文档并将其全部编译成单个 HTML 文件中的交互式界面要容易得多，也令人愉快。基于网络，我可以包含各种多媒体。我真的很喜欢这种创造力。我不是一个好的组织者，而《TW》让我在有机会沉浸在自己的思想中之后，抛开我的大脑，担心组织问题。\n\n## Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？\n\nYes and no. From a pure technical perspective I think TW5 we have today is the potential we saw decades ago. The web truly has become a wonderful environment and TW has captured that magic in a way many others have not. 是和不是。从纯粹的技术角度来看，我认为我们今天拥有的 TW5 就是我们几十年前看到的潜力。网络确实已经成为一个美妙的环境，而 TW 则以其他许多人没有的方式捕捉到了这种魔力。\n\nHowever, from an adoption perspective I don't think it has. I also think that is not a reflection of TiddlyWiki but of the social shift we've seen these last 20 years. I remember early on that people would interact with technology in a way that augmented or enhanced how we thought. But more recently I've seen a massive shift from that tech-as-a-tool creative perspective into a more do-it-for-me instant gratification perspective. 然而，从采用的角度来看，我认为没有。我还认为这不是 TiddlyWiki 的反映，而是我们过去 20 年所看到的社会转变的反映。我记得很早就人们与技术的互动方式会增强或增强我们的思维方式。但最近我看到了从 “技术即工具” 的创意视角到 “为我做事” 的即时满足视角的巨大转变。\n\nFor example, when I used to talk about TW and how it helped dump my brain I got engagement from others. Today when I do the same I'm quickly dismissed as an old fogy and the idea is lost on most. I also see this trend in more than just personal productivity but in creative works in general. The quality of craftsmanship has fallen very far and it scares me. 例如，当我过去谈论 TW 以及它如何帮助我摆脱大脑时，我得到了其他人的参与。今天，当我做同样的事情时，我很快就会被视为老顽固而被解雇，大多数人都失去了这个想法。我不仅在个人生产力方面而且在一般创造性工作中也看到了这种趋势。工艺品质下降很多，让我感到害怕。\n\n## Do you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki? 您在 TiddlyWiki 工作期间有什么最美好的回忆吗？\n\nI remember working on my blog site in WordPress and falling in love with the idea of static site generators so I moved to Jekyll which use Markdown to make websites. After a bit I didn't like that it forced (at the time not as popular) a different runtime on to my development machine (Ruby) and any time I wanted to do something about JavaScript I kinda had to *fight the framework*. I looked for a more JS ecosystem solution and found Metelsmith. but like most things JavaScript that quickly became out of control and unmaintainable. 我记得在 WordPress 中开发我的博客网站并爱上了静态网站生成器的想法，因此我转向使用 Markdown 制作网站的 Jekyll。过了一会儿，我不喜欢它在我的开发机器（Ruby）上强制（当时不那么流行）不同的运行时，并且任何时候我想要对 JavaScript 做一些事情，我都不得不与框架作斗争。我寻找更多 JS 生态系统解决方案并找到了 Metelsmith。但就像大多数事情一样，JavaScript 很快就失去了控制并且无法维护。\n\nIt was then that I realized the real issue wasn't the tech used but in how blogs were constructed. Well organized fully fleshed out thoughts. But what I wanted, what I needed was a dumping ground of whatever came out of my head. Snippets, tips, portfolios, links, and from time to time a fully thought out article. 就在那时，我意识到真正的问题不是所使用的技术，而是博客的构建方式。组织严密，思想充实。但我想要的，我需要的是一个倾倒我脑子里的东西的垃圾场。片段、技巧、组合、链接，有时还有一篇经过深思熟虑的文章。\n\nTiddlyWiki fit this bill. I could focus on creating tiddlers. Have a one stop searchable, tag-able, transposable, and customizable website of all kinds of ideas. As a Single Page Application developer this scratched every itch I had.TiddlyWiki 符合这个要求。我可以专注于创建 tiddlers。拥有一个包含各种想法的一站式可搜索、可标记、可转置和可定制的网站。作为一名单页应用程序开发人员，这满足了我的所有需求。\n\nNow I use it for all kinds of uses. [Minecraft tutorials](https://tritarget.org/wikis/minecraft/), daily task tracking at work, documentation, planning, and even end of life planning. 现在我将它用于各种用途。 Minecraft 教程、日常工作任务跟踪、文档、规划，甚至生命周期结束规划。\n\nIn one case it is my start page for work where I have tiddlers with `<audio>` tags for each music streaming service I like and I can pick which one to play while I work. 在一种情况下，它是我的工作起始页，其中我为我喜欢的每个音乐流媒体服务提供了带有 `<audio>` 标签的 tiddlers，我可以在工作时选择要播放的服务。\n\nThough I've since stopped pinning up [posters](https://tiddlywiki.com/poster/) about TW in every coffee shop I visit I still use it to this day and love it more each time. I do hope that the ideas we cherished 20 years ago will come around and gain momentum again least I know that TiddlyWiki (even if it doesn't change) will fit me and my personality well up to and likely beyond my own passing. 尽管我已经不再在我去过的每家咖啡店里张贴有关台湾的海报，但直到今天我仍然使用它，并且每次都更加喜欢它。我确实希望我们 20 年前珍视的想法能够再次出现并获得动力，至少我知道 TiddlyWiki（即使它没有改变）将非常适合我和我的个性，直到我去世，甚至可能超越我的去世。\n\nThank you very much to everyone who has and who will continue to make this philosophy realized through technology better and more attainable to everyone. 非常感谢所有已经并将继续通过技术更好、更容易地实现这一理念的人。\n\n### How are you doing? 你好吗？\n\nStill doing well, and using TiddlyWiki regularly, though mostly for small personal projects. 仍然表现良好，并定期使用 TiddlyWiki，尽管主要用于小型个人项目。\n\n### Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？\n\nI definitely learned a lot working on tiddlywiki, especially since it was my first real introduction to doing javascript development. However, my own professional work has moved in another direction, and I'm mostly doing sysadmin work now that doesn't overlap with Tiddlywiki very much. 我确实在 tiddlywiki 上学到了很多东西，特别是因为这是我第一次真正了解如何进行 javascript 开发。然而，我自己的专业工作已经转向另一个方向，我现在主要从事系统管理工作，与 Tiddlywiki 没有太多重叠。\n\n### Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？\n\nI do feel like TW is pretty amazing still, and regularly pull it out for different tasks. It continues to be one of the simplest to setup wikis, and yet I feel like it also provides incredible flexibility that outshines most other similar tools. It's still fantastic. 我确实觉得 TW 仍然非常令人惊奇，并且经常将其拿出来执行不同的任务。它仍然是设置最简单的 wiki 之一，但我觉得它还提供了令人难以置信的灵活性，超越了大多数其他类似工具。它仍然很棒。\n\n### Do you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki? 您在 TiddlyWiki 工作期间有什么最美好的回忆吗？\n\nI still fondly remember how many of us started to use TW for tabletop gaming around the same time. It was a lot of fun, collaboratively writing plugins to roll dice, manage combats, and track all the things in the imaginary game world. Seeing what other people wrote and being inspired to try using it as part of my game. 我仍然清楚地记得我们中有多少人大约在同一时间开始使用 TW 玩桌面游戏。协作编写插件来掷骰子、管理战斗以及跟踪想象的游戏世界中的所有事物，这非常有趣。看到其他人写的内容并受到启发尝试将其用作我的游戏的一部分。\n\nTiddlyWiki had an immeasurable, enduring influence not just on my career, such as it is, but also on my values: To this day, I regularly find myself referring back to [fundamental concepts](https://prepitaph.org/articles/creative-privacy/) TiddlyWiki instilled in me - many of which are often forgotten or ignored elsewhere. Having this background thus helps me keep my bearings working in this industry, whether it's worshipping at the altar of technical complexity or even just remembering humans exist in the world of technology.TiddlyWiki 不仅对我的职业生涯产生了不可估量的持久影响，而且对我的价值观也产生了不可估量的持久影响：直到今天，我发现自己经常回顾 TiddlyWiki 灌输给我的基本概念 - 其中许多经常被遗忘或忽视别处。因此，拥有这样的背景有助于我在这个行业继续工作，无论是崇拜技术复杂性的祭坛，还是仅仅记住人类存在于技术世界中。\n\nBy TiddlyWiki, I mean people. It was an immense privilege interacting with and learning from this community and the group Jeremy built around it. It also helps reminding myself that this privilege was afforded to me by sheer happenstance; I hope to be paying it forward. 我所说的 TiddlyWiki 指的是人。与这个社区以及 Jeremy 围绕它建立的团队互动并向他们学习是一种巨大的荣幸。它还有助于提醒自己，这种特权完全是偶然赋予我的。我希望能够继续付款。\n\nEvery so often I get a little sad that I haven't managed to keep on top of the community's impressive development. However, I guess that's the natural order of things; passing the baton to the next generation and all. Jeremy also taught me there's value in being part of the diaspora. 时不时地，我会因为没能跟上社区令人印象深刻的发展而感到有点难过。然而，我想这就是事情的自然顺序；将接力棒传递给下一代和所有人。杰里米还告诉我，成为海外侨民的一员是有价值的。\n\nEven so, I still have and use a number of TiddlyWiki documents (classic, mostly, though not exclusively) - and trust they will [remain operational](https://hachyderm.io/@FND/111874454670076867) longer than most files on my disk. 即便如此，我仍然拥有并使用许多 TiddlyWiki 文档（经典，大部分，但不完全） - 并且相信它们将比我磁盘上的大多数文件保持运行更长时间。\n\n### How are you doing? 你好吗？\n\nI am doing well thank you. Thank you for reaching out to me, to us 😊我做得很好，谢谢。感谢您联系我、联系我们😊\n\n### Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？\n\nI started working on TiddlyWiki when i found this great Timeline plugin that had been discontinued and needed just a little work to be compatible with newer versions of TW5. 当我发现这个很棒的时间轴插件已经停产并且只需要做一点工作就可以与更新版本的 TW5 兼容时，我开始使用 TiddlyWiki。\n\nI continued working on other plugins and then even offered a tiny little bit change to the core to match my needs. I am mostly interested and focused on bringing more time management tools and features to TW5. I have been thinking on contributing again in the past few years, and share some of the tweaks that are sitting on my system waiting to be shared with the community. 我继续开发其他插件，然后甚至对核心进行了一点点更改以满足我的需求。我最感兴趣并专注于为 TW5 带来更多时间管理工具和功能。在过去的几年里，我一直在考虑再次做出贡献，并分享我的系统上等待与社区分享的一些调整。\n\nI have been using TW in a professional context for almost 10 years now, and it helped a great deal with task management and as a personal knowledge base. TW also indirectly introduced me to Node.js and i got to learn to use that too in a broader manner. 我在专业环境中使用 TW 已有近 10 年了，它对任务管理和个人知识库有很大帮助。 TW 还间接向我介绍了 Node.js，我也学会了以更广泛的方式使用它。\n\n### Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？\n\nI found out about TW after v5 was released. I was looking for a self contained HTML file that could work as a journal, to keep track of what I was working on when and for how long, keeping detailed information about every day and even every task, as well as summarizing it on larger scales such as months and years, and being able to filter and sort the data. So in a way, it was up to the potential i was looking for even as it was when i found about it. 我是在 v5 发布后才知道 TW 的。我一直在寻找一个独立的 HTML 文件，它可以作为日记使用，以跟踪我在何时、持续多长时间所做的工作，保留每天甚至每项任务的详细信息，并在更大范围内进行总结例如月份和年份，并能够对数据进行过滤和排序。所以在某种程度上，这取决于我正在寻找的潜力，即使是当我发现它时也是如此。\n\nNow i see TW as a mature tool, fit for professional use, and yet I have ideas for new plugins to add some features i would like to see there. As soon as I find the time to work on them, I will be sure to share these with the community. 现在我认为 TW 是一个成熟的工具，适合专业用途，但我有关于新插件的想法，以添加一些我希望在那里看到的功能。一旦我找到时间来研究它们，我一定会与社区分享这些内容。\n\n### Do you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki? 您在 TiddlyWiki 工作期间有什么最美好的回忆吗？\n\nI enjoyed working with some other members of the community, and in particular [@felixhayashi](https://github.com/felixhayashi) as we adapted our respective plugins to improve performance and reduce footprint as we used to have several backend JS libraries in common (some were split since, and some were deprecated) 我喜欢与社区的其他一些成员一起工作，特别是当我们调整各自的插件以提高性能并减少占用空间时，因为我们曾经有几个共同的后端 JS 库（有些被分割，有些被弃用）\n\nI’m fine, thanks. After improving TiddlyWiki for some years, I try to improve the \"real world\" now. I am active in local politics, ordered a heat pump and will build a photovoltaic installation on the flat roof of our house in March or April. There is time for physical activities and some culture now and then, our children have become adults and in my job I inform people about saving energy and greenhouse gases. By the way: My successful application and CV was a TiddlyWiki mainly. 我很好，谢谢。在改进 TiddlyWiki 几年后，我现在尝试改进 “现实世界”。我积极参与当地政治，订购了一台热泵，并将于三月或四月在我们房子的平屋顶上建造一个光伏装置。时不时地有时间进行体育活动和一些文化活动，我们的孩子已经长大了，在我的工作中，我向人们宣传节约能源和温室气体。顺便说一句：我成功的申请和简历主要是 TiddlyWiki。\n\n```\nHas working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?\n```\n\nYes (see above), and from the other side my work influenced my way of using TiddlyWiki. When I joined the TiddlyWiki community (Google Groups, March 2015) I had been looking for a note taking tool with superpowers. Steve Schneider and the SUNYpoly MOOC showed me what was possible then. 是的（见上文），从另一方面来说，我的工作影响了我使用 TiddlyWiki 的方式。当我加入 TiddlyWiki 社区（Google Groups，2015 年 3 月）时，我一直在寻找一款具有超能力的笔记工具。 Steve Schneider 和纽约州立大学 MOOC 向我展示了当时的可能性。\n\nFor my job in sales and consulting at that time, ToDoNow was very valuable (<https://tid.li/tw5/tdn.html>) – I had lots of tasks and managing deadlines and priorities was important. It was also very time consuming to build it, so I am not sure it was a time saver all in all ... 对于我当时从事销售和咨询的工作来说，ToDoNow 非常有价值（https\\://tid.li/tw5/tdn.html）—— 我有很多任务，管理截止日期和优先级非常重要。构建它也非常耗时，所以我不确定它是否能节省时间......\n\nNowadays I rely on taking notes for different activities in different wikis, all pimped with my own collection of plugins (<https://tid.li/tw5/plugins.html>). ToDo lists are not important any more. 如今，我依靠为不同 wiki 中的不同活动做笔记，所有这些都使用我自己的插件集合（https\\://tid.li/tw5/plugins.html）。待办事项列表不再重要。\n\nWorking on TiddlyWiki stuff helped me to stay in touch with HTML and CSS and motivated me to learn SVG. 从事 TiddlyWiki 相关工作帮助我与 HTML 和 CSS 保持联系，并激励我学习 SVG。\n\nGitHub on the other hand is something I did not take the time to learn properly, so I needed help from others and got frustrated about abandoned pull requests like the cats I tried to donate to the project ([#2981](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/2981)). 另一方面，GitHub 是我没有花时间正确学习的东西，所以我需要其他人的帮助，并对废弃的拉取请求感到沮丧，比如我试图向该项目捐赠的猫 (#2981)。\n\n```\nIs TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?\n```\n\nWhen I started contributing I felt like a dwarf standing on the shoulders of giants only capable to throw in a thought here and there to keep the discussion alive. There were only few active members and some of them disappeared, so I was a bit afraid that TiddlyWiki would lose too much momentum. — That has changed completely. When I became a listener (I still follow some threads on <https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/>) I was sure that the community was healthier than I had ever seen it before and it grew and flourished even more since then. Congratulations to all of you, especially to [@Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) for building and being such a great and helpful and inspiring team! 当我开始贡献时，我感觉自己就像一个站在巨人肩膀上的侏儒，只能随处提出想法，让讨论保持活力。活跃成员很少，而且有些人消失了，所以我有点担心 TiddlyWiki 会失去太多动力。 —— 情况完全改变了。当我成为一名听众时（我仍然关注 https\\://talk.tiddlywiki.org/ 上的一些帖子），我确信社区比我以前见过的更健康，从那时起它就更加成长和繁荣。祝贺你们所有人，特别是祝贺你们建立并成为一个如此伟大、乐于助人、鼓舞人心的团队！\n\n```\nDo you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki?\n```\n\nMy first favourite \"hack\" was TextStretch. I did not expect it to survive for a long time, so I am really pleased to see it still works in my newest wikis, even if I never use it. <https://tid.li/tw5/test/TWnews.html#TextStretch> — Recently I was reminded of this when I stumbled upon <http://www.kevinsteele.com/smackerel/black_white_00.html> that has a similar effect. 我最喜欢的第一个 “hack” 是 TextStretch。我没想到它会存在很长时间，所以我很高兴看到它仍然可以在我最新的维基中使用，即使我从未使用过它。 https\\://tid.li/tw5/test/TWnews.html#TextStretch — 最近，当我偶然发现具有类似效果的 http\\://www\\.kevinsteele.com/smackerel/black\\_white\\_00.html 时，我想起了这一点。\n\nOne of the best features of TiddlyWiki is live hacking in an edit-text widget. This allows us to create tiny apps like my SVG Editor (<https://tid.li/tw5/apps/svg.html>) or to tune CSS tiddlers very efficiently. Just type and see the result immediately. Fantastic!TiddlyWiki 的最佳功能之一是在编辑文本小部件中进行实时黑客攻击。这使我们能够创建像 SVG 编辑器 (https\\://tid.li/tw5/apps/svg.html) 这样的小型应用程序，或者非常有效地调整 CSS tiddlers。只需键入并立即查看结果。极好的！\n\n[![@xcazin](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1314688?s=60\\&v=4)](https://github.com/xcazin)\n\nAlways loved TextStretch! 一直很喜欢 TextStretch！\n\nI only briefly used TiddlyWiki for some project planning many years ago (and shelved the project), and wrote some documentation after figuring out how to do something relatively advanced. So I don't have the same perspective as other contributors here, but I do enjoy responding to these sorts of prompts. 多年前我只是简单地使用过 TiddlyWiki 进行一些项目规划（并搁置了该项目），并在弄清楚如何做一些相对高级的事情后编写了一些文档。因此，我与这里的其他贡献者的观点不同，但我确实喜欢回应此类提示。\n\nMore recently, I've been working (mentally) on a design for a system for collaborative writing and editing - something like a Markdown-based wiki, but with taggable, explicitly-connected \"nodes\" rather than pages related only by HTML hyperlinking. I think I can say TiddlyWiki inspired the idea that - with a web app - I could display multiple nodes simultaneously rather than attaching the page \"wrapper\" boilerplate to everything, and that I could have an option to organize the node divs into a \"storyline\" view as well as just a bunch of nodes connected with lines (like a stereotypical conspiracy theorist's bulletin board). 最近，我一直在（精神上）设计一个用于协作写作和编辑的系统 - 类似于基于 Markdown 的 wiki，但具有可标记的、显式连接的 “节点”，而不是仅通过 HTML 超链接相关的页面。我想我可以说 TiddlyWiki 启发了这样一个想法：通过网络应用程序，我可以同时显示多个节点，而不是将页面 “包装器” 样板附加到所有内容，并且我可以选择将节点 div 组织成 “故事情节” “视图以及一堆用线连接的节点（就像典型的阴谋论者的公告板）。\n\n(I probably won't be working on this project any time for a while if ever; but I am planning to publish a more detailed design fairly soon.)（我可能在一段时间内不会从事这个项目；但我计划很快发布更详细的设计。）\n\nThank you Jeremy for the prompt! Many thanks as well to past and present developers, and to each active member of the community. 谢谢杰里米的提示！非常感谢过去和现在的开发人员，以及社区的每一位活跃成员。\n\nI have been contributing to the fr-FR translation since TW5 started, about 10 years ago, and my company sponsored the development of the quite ambitious [TWPUB](https://github.com/TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools), although on both fronts, I haven't been able to devote any serious time for several months. I also fancy that I may one day contribute two TW5 \"books\" back to the community: one about serving TW5 documents from your pocket —your mobile phone, that is— and another about building user interfaces for maintaining and querying smallish databases within TW5. Unfortunately, retirement is still a few years ahead! 大约 10 年前，自从 TW5 启动以来，我一直在为 fr-FR 翻译做出贡献，我的公司赞助了雄心勃勃的 TWPUB 的开发，尽管在这两个方面，我已经好几个月没能投入任何认真的时间了。我还幻想有一天我可以向社区贡献两本 TW5 “书”：一本是关于从你的口袋（即你的手机）提供 TW5 文档，另一本是关于构建用户界面以维护和查询 TW5 中的小型数据库。不幸的是，退休还有几年！\n\nI believe my fondest memories about working with TiddlyWiki were the few meetings we had with [@Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) and [@jdjdjdjdjdjd](https://github.com/jdjdjdjdjdjd), aka JD, around an early version of TWPUB, which my company is still using 5 years later. For many reasons, having the opportunity to collaborate with these two outstanding people together over 8 time zones on a project of mine was very striking. 我相信，我与 TiddlyWiki 合作最美好的回忆是我们与 and（又名 JD）围绕 TWPUB 的早期版本举行的几次会议，我的公司在 5 年后仍在使用该版本。出于多种原因，有机会与这两位杰出人士跨越 8 个时区共同合作完成我的一个项目，这真是令人印象深刻。\n\nEventhough I didn't develop anything recently, I use TiddlyWiki every single day, whether to maintain our knowledge bases at work, or to add some notes to my personal wikis, or to test in a sandbox any wikitext construct that comes to mind out, of curiosity. All these wikis are served either by the NodeJS mode, or via WebDav thanks to the [recent work](https://saqimtiaz.github.io/tw5-plugins-sandbox/#WebDAV%20Utils) of [@saqimtiaz](https://github.com/saqimtiaz). My best achievement so far as a TiddlyWiki power user has been to set up a wiki server on my wife's phone 5 years ago, which she uses anytime to write down and categorise her thoughts about exhibitions, readings, or movies. Several hundred tiddlers later, she fully owns it, and never felt the need for one of those dedicated apps that may disappear any day ;-) 尽管我最近没有开发任何东西，但我每天都会使用 TiddlyWiki，无论是在工作中维护我们的知识库，还是向我的个人 wiki 添加一些注释，或者在沙箱中测试任何想到的 wiki 文本结构，出于好奇。所有这些 wiki 要么通过 NodeJS 模式提供服务，要么通过 WebDav 提供服务，这要归功于。作为 TiddlyWiki 高级用户，我迄今为止最好的成就是 5 年前在我妻子的手机上建立了一个 wiki 服务器，她可以随时用它来写下并分类她对展览、阅读或电影的想法。几百个 tiddler 之后，她完全拥有了它，并且从未觉得需要那些随时可能消失的专用应用程序之一；-)\n\nIn addition to witnessing every day the power of individual and collective intelligence, one of the great thing about Open Source efforts such as TiddlyWiki is that the solutions to a problem are often more ambitious and visionary than the time-constrained ad hoc solutions we typically see in industry. For example, the MultiWikiServer plugin [recently announced](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/announcing-the-multiwikiserver-plugin/9033) by Jeremy renewed my interest for TW once again as it promises to bring in new powerful features without altering the product nor making it more complex to use. 除了每天见证个人和集体智慧的力量之外，TiddlyWiki 等开源项目的一大优点是，问题的解决方案往往比我们通常看到的受时间限制的临时解决方案更加雄心勃勃和富有远见。在工业中。例如，Jeremy 最近宣布的 MultiWikiServer 插件再次激起了我对 TW 的兴趣，因为它承诺在不改变产品也不使其使用变得更加复杂的情况下引入新的强大功能。\n\nSince TiddlyWiki always seems to push the boundaries of expectations, it does influence my thoughts about what makes the Web truly useful nowadays: my fantasy about TW infinite possibilities is what drives my desire of (net) working differently. For instance, I was frustrated at work by the fact that the main ebook format was EPUB, no more than a static collection of HTML pages. For 20 years, I had instead wanted fully interactive web books and it seemed obvious that TiddlyWiki was the only format that could possibly fulfill this role. This lead me to sponsor the development of an EPUB ehancer based on TiddlyWiki, aka TWPUB. Once it is complete, il will allow us to automatically convert the EPUBs that our publishing customers entrust to us into true read-write, interactive and multimedia web books that final customers can enjoy as they enjoy rich websites today. 由于 TiddlyWiki 似乎总是突破期望的界限，它确实影响了我对当今网络真正有用的想法：我对 TW 无限可能性的幻想推动了我以不同方式（网络）工作的愿望。例如，我在工作中感到沮丧，因为主要的电子书格式是 EPUB，只不过是 HTML 页面的静态集合。 20 年来，我一直想要完全交互式的网络图书，而 TiddlyWiki 似乎是唯一能够满足这一角色的格式。这促使我赞助开发基于 TiddlyWiki（又名 TWPUB）的 EPUB 增强器。一旦完成，il 将允许我们自动将出版客户委托给我们的 EPUB 转换为真正的读写、交互式和多媒体网络图书，最终客户可以像今天享受丰富的网站一样享受这些网络图书。\n\nThank you [@Jermolene](https://github.com/Jermolene) for thinking of us. :) Personally, it is always a great pleasure to use and develop TiddlyWiki, but I like the community built around it even more: lots of smart, broad-minded people who solve their own tasks in incredibly diverse ways and this gives inspiration and encouragement to others. Whatever direction my note-taking habit or even my programming career takes, I will always think of the TiddlyWiki era with gratitude and happiness. 谢谢你为我们着想。 :) 就我个人而言，使用和开发 TiddlyWiki 总是一件非常愉快的事情，但我更喜欢围绕它建立的社区：许多聪明、心胸宽广的人以极其多样化的方式解决自己的任务，这给了灵感和鼓励给其他人。无论我的笔记习惯，甚至我的编程生涯走向何方，我都会怀着感激和幸福的心情想起 TiddlyWiki 时代。\n\n> How are you doing? 你好吗？\n\nThank you, luckily my life is going well. My relationship didn't turn out the way I wanted, but I'm very happy that my ex-partner and I found each other, because I think we raised each other to a higher level. My professional life is also moving in the right direction, I am finally a full-fledged devops /programmer in a place where I can learn a lot and where I can ask my questions (before that I was the only developer at a small company, which has its own beauty, but the there were many obstacles to professional development). 谢谢你，幸运的是我的生活一切顺利。我的关系没有按照我想要的方式发展，但我很高兴我和我的前伴侣找到了彼此，因为我认为我们将彼此提升到了更高的水平。我的职业生涯也朝着正确的方向发展，我终于成为一名成熟的 DevOps / 程序员，在这里我可以学到很多东西，可以提出我的问题（之前我是一家小公司唯一的开发人员，它有它自己的美丽，但职业发展有很多障碍）。\n\n> Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？\n\nI think the answer is yes, because in addition to TiddlyWiki's programming solutions, I was also influenced by its philosophy: all data should be as minimal and general as possible, and special solutions should only be used in very justified cases. When I get a task in which I have to structure data, I try to use the solutions I learned in TiddlyWiki to figure out how I would organize them if the data were tiddlers. 我认为答案是肯定的，因为除了 TiddlyWiki 的编程解决方案之外，我还受到它的哲学的影响：所有数据都应该尽可能最小化和通用，特殊的解决方案应该只在非常合理的情况下使用。当我接到一个必须构建数据的任务时，我尝试使用我在 TiddlyWiki 中学到的解决方案来弄清楚如果数据是 tiddlers，我将如何组织它们。\n\n> Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？\n\nDefinitely yes. I remember the time when I was developing the <https://bimlas.github.io/demo/tw5/property-comparison.html> solution and that made me aware of the true nature of TiddlyWiki: it is a framework for objects. In fact, each tiddler is an object that has some exceptionally handled properties (title, text, tags), but it can easily handle a music collection, family tree, schedule, anything in which objects have properties and a relationship between them needs to be represented. Filters, macros and widgets are so well abstracted that they can be used for everything due to their generality. I really like that TiddlyWiki is so flexible and that note management is really just one example of how it can be used, but it's best used as a framework. 绝对是的。我记得当我开发 https\\://bimlas.github.io/demo/tw5/property-comparison.html 解决方案时，这让我意识到 TiddlyWiki 的真正本质：它是一个对象框架。事实上，每个 tiddler 都是一个对象，它有一些特殊处理的属性（标题，文本，标签），但它可以轻松处理音乐收藏，家谱，时间表，任何对象具有属性并且它们之间的关系需要被代表。过滤器、宏和小部件被很好地抽象化，由于它们的通用性，它们可以用于任何事情。我真的很喜欢 TiddlyWiki 的灵活性，笔记管理实际上只是它如何使用的一个示例，但它最好用作框架。\n\nI would add that wiki syntax is not always easy to work with, but it is a necessary part of flexibility. :) 我想补充一点，wiki 语法并不总是易于使用，但它是灵活性的必要组成部分。 :)\n\n> Do you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki? 您在 TiddlyWiki 工作期间有什么最美好的回忆吗？\n\nOne of these is the above-mentioned relevation, but in reality there is no such specific moment. I like when we come up with solutions together with the community, but I also find joy when I experience the sublime moment of reaching a solution alone. 其中之一就是上述关联，但实际上并不存在这样的具体时刻。我喜欢我们与社区一起提出解决方案，但当我经历独自达成解决方案的崇高时刻时，我也会感到快乐。\n\nI wish you much success and happiness in your personal life as well, and thank you for giving the community the energy, knowledge and wisdom you have invested in TiddlyWiki! This thanks goes to all contributors as well! 👏我也祝愿您在个人生活中取得成功和幸福，并感谢您为社区贡献了在 TiddlyWiki 中投入的精力、知识和智慧！也感谢所有贡献者！ 👏\n\nHello there! BTW I finally made Tiddloid 2.5.0 last week (after an absence of a year *(:зゝ∠)*) 你好呀！顺便说一句，我上周终于制作了 Tiddloid 2.5.0（阔别一年之后 (:зゝ∠)）\n\nA big thank you for the responses, which I have very much enjoyed and much appreciate. It is great to hear from everyone. 非常感谢您的回复，我非常喜欢并非常感谢。很高兴收到大家的来信。\n\n[@Telumire](https://github.com/Telumire) – I'm glad to hear that things are improving, and I hope your upward trajectory continues apace. Very pleased to hear that TiddlyWiki is still part of your life.– 我很高兴听到事情正在改善，我希望你的上升轨迹继续快速发展。很高兴听到 TiddlyWiki 仍然是您生活的一部分。\n\n[@grayeul](https://github.com/grayeul) - delighted to hear you're still enjoying TiddlyWiki, and I hope you'll continue. Absolutely no problem about your contributions not materialising, it was still a useful learning experience for me.- 很高兴听到您仍然喜欢 TiddlyWiki，希望您继续。你的贡献没有实现绝对没有问题，这对我来说仍然是一次有用的学习经历。\n\n[@Skeeve](https://github.com/Skeeve) - I hope your son is thriving, I remember meeting you both very well. Your contributions definitely helped stretch the core, and are still much appreciated.- 我希望你的儿子茁壮成长，我记得很清楚见到你们俩。您的贡献无疑有助于扩展核心，并且仍然非常感谢。\n\n[@sukima](https://github.com/sukima) - thanks for your thoughtful reflections, which remind me how much I enjoyed your perspective. I'm glad you are still on the same journey.- 感谢您深思熟虑的思考，这提醒我我是多么喜欢您的观点。我很高兴你仍然在同一个旅程上。\n\n[@mklauber](https://github.com/mklauber) - great to hear from you. You made a big impact very swiftly, I think really helping to coalesce a community that was latent and inchoate. I still feel an enormous kinship for the rpg mindset and consider it a mark of honour to have made an impact in that space.- 很高兴听到你的消息。你很快就产生了巨大的影响，我认为这确实有助于凝聚一个潜在的、不成熟的社区。我仍然对角色扮演游戏的心态有一种巨大的亲缘关系，并认为在这个领域产生影响是一种荣誉。\n\n[@FND](https://github.com/FND) - thank you – as you know, I admire your writing enormously, and enjoyed [your recent post about browser file system access](https://prepitaph.org/articles/web-fs/). It is very gratifying that you credit TiddlyWiki, and I much appreciate it.- 谢谢 - 如您所知，我非常欣赏您的写作，并且喜欢您最近关于浏览器文件系统访问的帖子。非常高兴您对 TiddlyWiki 的认可，我非常感激。\n\n[@kixam](https://github.com/kixam) – thank you for the thoughtful comments, I like the idea that TiddlyWiki's most important and useful characteristics have been there from the beginning.– 感谢您深思熟虑的评论，我喜欢 TiddlyWiki 最重要和最有用的特性从一开始就存在的想法。\n\n[@telmiger](https://github.com/telmiger) - great to hear of your journey, and I admire the environmental work that you are doing tremendously. I'll have a look at [#2981](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/2981) again.- 很高兴听到你的旅程，我很钦佩你所做的巨大的环保工作。我会再看看 #2981。\n\n[@zahlman](https://github.com/zahlman) - that sounds interesting. Maybe TiddlyMap could help you prototype your ideas?- 听起来很有趣。也许 TiddlyMap 可以帮助您原型化您的想法？\n\n[@xcazin](https://github.com/xcazin) - thank you, great to hear your perspective. I also enjoyed working with [@jdjdjdjdjd](https://github.com/jdjdjdjdjd). The TWPub work was very productive from my point of view, and will influence the core for some time to come as we integrate the navigation improvements to the core. I am also delighted that we got the basic EPUB-to-tiddlers conversion going so well, it makes TWPub useful for a wide audience.- 谢谢你，很高兴听到你的观点。我也很喜欢与 一起工作。从我的角度来看，TWPub 的工作非常富有成效，并且随着我们将导航改进集成到核心中，它将在未来一段时间内影响核心。我也很高兴我们将 EPUB 到 tiddlers 的基本转换进展顺利，这使得 TWPub 对广大受众有用。\n\n[@bimlas](https://github.com/bimlas) - thank you for the kind words and the interesting reflections, the data model of TiddlyWiki is something we take for granted but its success at modelling a wide range of data deserves wider analysis.- 感谢您的客气话和有趣的思考，TiddlyWiki 的数据模型是我们认为理所当然的东西，但它在建模广泛数据方面的成功值得更广泛的分析。\n\n[@donmor](https://github.com/donmor) - good to see you back. I know a lot of people depend on Tiddloid, so it's great to have an update.- 很高兴见到你回来。我知道很多人都依赖 Tiddloid，所以很高兴有更新。\n\nBy the way, this response is not intended to close this discussion. I'd love to hear from more contributors, and continue this discussion. 顺便说一下，这个回应并不是为了结束这个讨论。我很乐意听到更多贡献者的意见，并继续讨论。\n\n**How are you doing? 你好吗？**\\\nI'm fine, thank you! I'm still alive! Maybe even more alive after I've abandoned the city and the IT industry for good and I've moved to the country side with my family. I don't want to be part of this IT thing anymore because I don't like the direction is heading. Technology has become a scope in itself not just a mean to achieve something really useful. It's moving very fast towards nowhere, exactly like our modern civilization! And I don't want to hear anything about AI also. This bulls\\*\\*t will replace almost all humans soon. I hate that and I believe this is very wrong! I'm telling you honestly what I think, I don't want to offend somebody. 我很好，谢谢你！我还活着！在我永远放弃了城市和 IT 行业并与家人一起搬到乡村后，也许我的生活更有活力了。我不想再参与 IT 行业了，因为我不喜欢这个方向。技术本身已经成为一种范围，而不仅仅是实现真正有用的东西的手段。它正快速地走向无处可去，就像我们的现代文明一样！我也不想听到任何有关人工智能的事情。这个混蛋很快就会取代几乎所有人类。我讨厌这样，我相信这是非常错误的！我诚实地告诉你我的想法，我不想冒犯任何人。\n\n**Has working on TiddlyWiki influenced your own way of working?TiddlyWiki 的工作对您自己的工作方式有影响吗？**\\\nI've used TiddlyWiki only as a personal digital brain to store my knowledge, any kind of knowledge, and I'm still using it today for the same purpose. I had to accommodate it's vision firstly but was for a greater good in the end. 我仅使用 TiddlyWiki 作为个人数字大脑来存储我的知识，任何类型的知识，并且今天我仍然出于相同的目的使用它。我首先必须适应它的愿景，但最终是为了更大的利益。\n\n**Is TiddlyWiki reaching the potential you saw when you were contributing?TiddlyWiki 是否达到了您在贡献时所看到的潜力？**\\\nI haven't discovered its real potential at first. It seemed to me like a simplistic app at first and I've discarded it fairly easily. Then, somehow I've discovered WikiText and had a moment of \"Eureka\". It has so much power with WikiText. But I still don't like the way the documentation is structured and organized. For me it's really a mess. I really can't find what I'm looking in a short amount of time. I don't know, maybe it's just my problem. 我一开始还没有发现它的真正潜力。起初在我看来，它就像一个简单的应用程序，我很容易就放弃了它。然后，不知怎的，我发现了维基文本，并有一个 “尤里卡” 的时刻。维基文本具有如此强大的力量。但我仍然不喜欢文档的结构和组织方式。对我来说，这真的是一团糟。我真的无法在短时间内找到我要找的东西。我不知道，也许这只是我的问题。\n\n**Do you have any favourite memories of working on TiddlyWiki? 您在 TiddlyWiki 工作期间有什么最美好的回忆吗？**\\\nI've enjoyed very much developing in TiddlyWiki, finding solutions and be creative. The fact that TiddlyWiki is highly customisable by an average user through WikiText is a major advantage compared to other knowledge management apps. On the other hand I'm glad that I've offered something in return by contributing to the core (mainly the Explorer tab) and to the community with TW-Icons site. It is a very good thing that TiddlyWiki is evolving continuously but it's becoming very difficult for me to keep track of all the new developments. So I don't think I will contribute anymore. But the \"What's New\" page is always a pleasure to read when a new version is out. 我非常喜欢在 TiddlyWiki 中进行开发，寻找解决方案并发挥创造力。与其他知识管理应用程序相比，普通用户可以通过 WikiText 高度定制 TiddlyWiki，这一事实是一个主要优势。另一方面，我很高兴通过为核心（主要是资源管理器选项卡）和 TW-Icons 网站社区做出贡献来提供一些回报。 TiddlyWiki 不断发展是一件非常好的事情，但对我来说跟踪所有新的发展变得非常困难。所以我想我不会再做出贡献了。但当新版本发布时，阅读 “新增内容” 页面总是令人愉悦。\n\nIn conclusion long live TiddlyWiki and it's community! 总之，TiddlyWiki 及其社区万岁！\n\n<!-- '\"` -->\n\n<!-- </textarea></xmp> -->\n\n<!-- '\"` -->\n\n<!-- </textarea></xmp> -->\n\n### Add a comment 添加评论\n\nComment\n\nWe don’t support that file type.\n\nTry again with GIF, JPEG, JPG, MOV, MP4, PNG, SVG, WEBM, CPUPROFILE, CSV, DMP, DOCX, FODG, FODP, FODS, FODT, GZ, JSON, JSONC, LOG, MD, ODF, ODG, ODP, ODS, ODT, PATCH, PDF, PPTX, TGZ, TXT, XLS, XLSX or ZIP.\n\nAttaching documents requires write permission to this repository.\n\nTry again with GIF, JPEG, JPG, MOV, MP4, PNG, SVG, WEBM, CPUPROFILE, CSV, DMP, DOCX, FODG, FODP, FODS, FODT, GZ, JSON, JSONC, LOG, MD, ODF, ODG, ODP, ODS, ODT, PATCH, PDF, PPTX, TGZ, TXT, XLS, XLSX or ZIP.\n\nThis file is empty.\n\nTry again with a file that’s not empty.\n\nThis file is hidden.\n\nTry again with another file.\n\nSomething went really wrong, and we can’t process that file.\n\nTry again.\n",
