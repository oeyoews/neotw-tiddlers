What influences developers to adopt a product? 是什么影响开发者采用产品？

Trust. The tools they adopt and advocate for impact their reputation. You might have heard “no one ever got fired for buying IBM” in reference to making good choices. 相信。他们采用和倡导的工具会影响他们的声誉。您可能听说过 “没有人会因为购买 IBM 而被解雇”，这是指做出正确的选择。

But picking older, well-adopted tools can be at odds with how fast the industry moves. Is there a newer alternative that solves my needs better? Ask your developer. 但选择较旧的、广泛采用的工具可能与行业发展的速度不一致。是否有更新的替代方案可以更好地解决我的需求？询问您的开发商。

Keeping up the latest trends is part of their job. They need to know what's a fad and what's here to stay. This is why experienced developers become skeptical of almost everything. It's hard to earn their trust. 跟上最新趋势是他们工作的一部分。他们需要知道什么是时尚，什么是永恒的。这就是为什么经验丰富的开发人员对几乎所有事情都持怀疑态度。很难赢得他们的信任。

Developer marketing is about building trust. Here's what's worked for me. 开发者营销的目的是建立信任。这对我有用。

## [](#how-can-i-improve-my-developer-marketing)How can I improve my developer marketing? 如何改进我的开发者营销？

1. Don’t publish content you wouldn’t share yourself. 不要发布您自己不会分享的内容。
2. Always consider how you can build developer trust. It’s not a one-time transaction. It’s reflected in every product and marketing decision you make. 始终考虑如何建立开发人员的信任。这不是一次性交易。它反映在您做出的每一个产品和营销决策中。
3. When something sucks with your product, own it. Don’t try to hide the failure. Lean into it. Bring the community along for the continuous iteration of your product. “You told us this was bad, and we fixed it”. Follow up with people after you ship. 当你的产品出现问题时，就拥有它。不要试图掩盖失败。倚靠它。让社区与您一起不断迭代您的产品。 “你告诉我们这很糟糕，我们就解决了它”。发货后跟进人员。
4. Get involved in the community. Host, attend, or sponsor a hackathon or meetup. Spend time talking to developers 1:1. Their feedback drives product improvements *and* content ideas. Where are people struggling? Write about that. 参与社区。主持、参加或赞助黑客马拉松或聚会。花时间与开发人员一对一交谈。他们的反馈推动了产品改进和内容创意。人们在哪里挣扎？写一下这个。
5. Create a [developer experience so good](https://leerob.io/blog/developer-experience-examples) that it does marketing for you. Write docs worth sharing, filled with helpful diagrams and detailed descriptions. Create code examples and templates that help developers get started quickly. 打造良好的开发者体验，为您进行营销。编写值得分享的文档，其中包含有用的图表和详细描述。创建代码示例和模板，帮助开发人员快速入门。

## [](#throw-out-the-old-playbook)Throw out the old playbook 扔掉旧的剧本

Developers *love* great marketing, but most companies get it wrong. 开发人员喜欢出色的营销，但大多数公司都搞错了。

They’re trying to apply the enterprise marketing playbook to the wrong audience. 他们试图将企业营销手册应用于错误的受众。

* **Enterprise Marketing 企业营销**

  * **Goal**: Grow pipeline and revenue 目标：增加渠道和收入
  * **Audience**: Directors, VPs, or C-suite 受众：董事、副总裁或最高管理层
  * **Buyer Interests**: Increased efficiency, cost savings, innovation 买家利益：提高效率、节省成本、创新
  * **How**: Sales-served, sign a yearly contract for a discount 方式：销售服务，签订年度折扣合同

* **Developer Marketing 开发商营销**

  * **Goal**: Grow retained signups and community awareness 目标：增加留存注册人数和社区意识
  * **Audience**: Individual developers 受众：个人开发者
  * **Buyer Interests**: Transferable skills, affordable, great developer experience 买家兴趣：可转移的技能、价格实惠、出色的开发人员体验
  * **How**: Self-serve, start free then swipe a credit card 方式：自助服务，免费开始，然后刷信用卡

## [](#what-does-great-developer-marketing-look-like)What does great developer marketing look like? 优秀的开发者营销是什么样的？

I’m a developer who [works](https://leerob.io/work) at the intersection of engineering, product, and marketing. Based on my experience, the best developer marketing: 我是一名从事工程、产品和营销交叉领域工作的开发人员。根据我的经验，最好的开发者营销：

1. **Teaches how to build great products 教授如何打造出色的产品**
2. **Builds and retains trust 建立并保持信任**
3. **Uses precise language 使用精确的语言**

### [](#how-did-they-build-that)How did they build that!? 他们是如何建造的！？

When I see a great developer tool, my first thought is: **how did they build that?**当我看到一个很棒的开发工具时，我的第一个想法是：他们是如何构建它的？

this is so fast it is actually weird, my brain seems unable to accept such fast UI on an ecommerce website 这速度太快了，真的很奇怪，我的大脑似乎无法接受电子商务网站上如此快的用户界面

The fastest storefront I've ever seen. So excited about the new Next.js Commerce powered by App Router. Headless backend by @shopify 我见过的最快的店面。 对由 App Router 提供支持的新 Next.js Commerce 感到非常兴奋。 @shopify 的无头后端.

There’s a natural curiosity. I want to reverse engineer the product and [learn new tools](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-next-js-commerce-2-0) or skills I can apply to my work. 有一种天生的好奇心。我想对产品进行逆向工程并学习可以应用于工作的新工具或技能。

The best developer marketing shows how to build great product experiences. Bonus points if you capture the “current thing” – a new AI tool, or a popular style of app (TikTok clone). 最好的开发者营销展示了如何打造出色的产品体验。如果您捕捉到 “当前事物”，即新的人工智能工具或流行风格的应用程序（TikTok 克隆），则会获得奖励积分。

Great developer marketing is invoking this response as a service. 伟大的开发者营销正在将这种响应作为一种服务来调用。

### [](#zero-days-since-the-latest-javascript-framework)Zero days since the latest JavaScript framework 自最新 JavaScript 框架推出以来的零日时间

Developers don’t try your product the first time they hear about it. They certainly don’t want to talk to someone to get access first. 开发人员不会在第一次听说你的产品时就尝试它。他们当然不想先与某人交谈以获得访问权限。

They need to hear positive feedback several times before they trust it enough to try. That's why **building, growing, and retaining developer trust is everything.**他们需要多次听到积极的反馈，然后才会有足够的信心去尝试。这就是为什么建立、发展和保持开发人员的信任至关重要。

Trust comes from your marketing being helpful regardless of the product. And retention comes from [making something developers actually want](https://leerob.io/blog/make-something-developers-want). 信任来自于你的营销是否有帮助，无论产品如何。留存来自于开发者真正想要的东西。

Individual developers are tired of enterprise marketing being used on them. They’re the wrong audience—they don’t want the cold calls or unhelpful emails. And if you lose their trust, they’re quick to move on to other products. 个人开发者厌倦了对他们使用企业营销。他们是错误的受众 —— 他们不想要推销电话或无用的电子邮件。如果你失去了他们的信任，他们很快就会转向其他产品。

![I don't want to play with you anymore](https://leerob.io/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdeveloper-marketing%2Ftoy-story.png\&w=1080\&q=75)

Trust is built (or lost) through the content you create and put out into the community. It’s a reflection of what you stand for. 信任是通过您创建并发布到社区的内容建立（或失去）的。这反映了您的立场。

Here are some of my red flags when reading developer content: 以下是我在阅读开发者内容时遇到的一些危险信号：

* **Buzzwords and acronyms**: Sometimes these are necessary, but there’s a lot of copywriting that looks like “cutting-edge, LLM-powered RAG platform” when it should really be “bring knowledge to your AI model”. Acronyms also alienate newcomers. 流行语和缩略语：有时这些是必要的，但有很多文案看起来像是 “尖端的、LLM 驱动的 RAG 平台”，而实际上它应该是 “为你的 AI 模型带来知识”。缩写词也会疏远新来者。
* **Misusing technical terms**: "Our JavaScript framework helps you make responsive websites” – does it though, or is that CSS? This can degrade trust because it shows the author might not have a deep understanding of the subject. Another example is broken or incorrectly formatted code examples. Did they even check that it works? 滥用技术术语：“我们的 JavaScript 框架可以帮助您制作响应式网站”—— 确实如此，还是 CSS？这可能会降低信任度，因为它表明作者可能对该主题没有深入的了解。另一个例子是损坏或格式不正确代码示例。他们是否检查过它是否有效？
* **Overpromising simplicity**: The developer ecosystem is too obsessed with simplicity. I’m guilty. While “get started in one click” might be good sometimes, it can also be harmful. Maybe I want more options? "Simply install our SDK" might not be as simple as it sounds. 过度承诺简单性：开发者生态系统过于痴迷于简单性。我有罪。虽然 “一键启动” 有时可能是好的，但也可能是有害的。也许我想要更多选择？ “只需安装我们的 SDK” 可能并不像听起来那么简单。
* **Vague explanations**: Developers want a practical example of what your product does. “Utilizing the latest technology to supercharge your development process”. Is this an editor, framework, database, or something else?

Developers are more likely to trust open-source tools. These tools likely [have a community](https://janairis.medium.com/five-pillars-of-building-developer-communities-at-hashicorp-9c8f50198eb8) of other developers learning together. They can take their knowledge of the tool from job to job as they grow in their career.

### [](#show-dont-tell)Show, don’t tell

Great developer marketing is both *concise* and *precise*.

It values your time—every word matters. Show them how to build interesting things, don’t fill a post with 1000 words of garbage.

Consider an email announcing a new version of your product. The pricing has changed, and there's a data migration.

* **How can I make it concise?**

  * **Put the bottom line up front**: If I stop reading after the first paragraph, did I get what I needed to know? Is there action required? Put that in the email subject line.
  * **Make it easy to scan**: The visual flow of the content is as important as the words you choose. They should be able to quickly scan for landmarks (like code examples or commands they need to run).

* **How can I make it precise?**

  * **Address their fears directly**: This email mentions a migration. Am I going to lose my data? Do I need to make changes right away? Am I going to be charged more?
  * **Personalize the content**: Show them their team name, the date the migration starts and finishes in UTC, exactly how much their price was before and after, and how they can take action (maybe a CLI command that shows their usage).

## [](#what-do-you-want-them-to-remember)What do you want them to remember?

Your product is competing between thousands of others for developer mindshare. You believe yours is better. How do you share that message?

Let the product speak for itself. Listen to customer feedback and iterate. If your marketing isn’t working, their feedback should tell you why.

You’re doing sales because you failed at marketing. You’re doing marketing because you failed at product.

This tweet is provocative, but it makes a point: you can't fix a bad product with more marketing and sales. When you believe in the product, you don’t need to speak down against others. I prefer to do the opposite.

I believe in optimism for software, the web, and the community I’m building. I want people to remember I was helpful, positive, and enthusiastic about the product.

## [](#wait-what-about-devrel)Wait, what about DevRel?

[Developer Relations](https://leerob.io/blog/devrel-at-vercel) is more than only developer marketing. It's the intersection between product, engineering, marketing, and sales.

For early companies, you might only need DevRel. They are generalists. But as you grow, you need to specialize. Get the right leaders for both developers and enterprise marketing.

Developer marketing leaders come from non-marketing roles (engineering, developer relations). They love showing developers how to build amazing things.

Enterprise marketing leaders come from traditional marketing roles (content, product marketing, growth). They can sell to developers, even if not one, and know how to build a pipeline generating engine.

It’s possible for one person to do both sides of marketing well, but rare.
