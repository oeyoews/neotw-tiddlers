## Summary

Jeremy Ruston explores what made the BBC Micro attractive and what can be learned from it today.

## Bio

Jeremy Ruston started his computing career as a teenager writing articles for computer magazines, leading to a book contract when he was 15. His second book was "The BBC Micro Revealed", one of the first to expose the more arcane inner workings of the BBC Micro. His third book was published by BBC Publications, which led to Jeremy being invited to create the first Doctor Who computer game.

## Transcript

Ruston: My name is Jeremy Ruston. You may know me for my work on an open source project called TiddlyWiki, which is 20 years old this year. I'm actually only going to talk about that tangentially, and leave this here to whet your appetite. I hope instead to take you on a journey back to the very early days of home computers in the UK, and use my experiences then to help us think about the landscape that we see around us today, and the challenges that we face for the future. We'll talk about technology, but also culture and communities.

We'll hear a little from the young man on the left. We'll be seeing some extremely fruity, old 1980s computer animations. I should first apologize to people who might feel strongly about other home computers, and there were many other fine home computers in the '80s. I'm not denigrating those at all. Perhaps a machine like the Spectrum might have had more influence on the games industry than the BBC Micro.

The BBC Micro was unique in its influence on the broader computer industry. Of course, I wasn't one of the pioneers who built these machines, or built that generation of hardware and software. QCon has already been lucky enough to hear from some of those people such as Sophie Wilson, and I highly recommend those talks. I was just an enthusiast, a fan in the right place at the right time.

## Computers, in the Culture of the 1980s

Let's step into this handy TARDIS and go back to January 30, 1983. 让我们走进这台方便的 TARDIS，回到 1983 年 1 月 30 日。

Interviewer: In South East at 6 tonight, Mastering the Microchip, are two teenager's expertise on computers is making them a fortune. You don't need a computer to tell you that we're now living in the age of the microchip. Our homes are randomly being invaded by mini computers, 17-year-old Jeremy Ruston, and Alex Gollner who's 15, are two London school boys who stand to make about 16,000 pounds between them this year, cashing in on the computer craze. 采访者：今晚六点在东南部举行的 Mastering the Microchip 节目中，两位青少年的计算机专业知识正在让他们发家致富。您不需要计算机来告诉您我们现在生活在微芯片时代。我们的家经常被迷你电脑入侵，17 岁的杰里米・拉斯顿 (Jeremy Ruston) 和 15 岁的亚历克斯・戈尔纳 (Alex Gollner) 是伦敦的两个男孩，他们今年有望在电脑热潮中赚到约 16,000 英镑。

Ruston: Strip away the prurient interest in money, and the focus on our ages. That little news slot actually quite neatly shows how computers sat in the culture of that time. There was excitement about them, and that was newsworthy, but really, I was there as a curiosity. Computers were new and exotic, vaguely threatening things that the vast majority of people at that time would never even have knowingly laid eyes on. In fact, at that time, my parents would bring their friends up to my bedroom, or hackerspaces, just to marvel at the sight of a computer, rather, as people in the 20s marveled at the sight of aeroplanes passing overhead. The thing I love is that now those people are all addicted to their iPad. 拉斯顿：抛开对金钱的淫荡兴趣，以及对我们年龄的关注。这个小新闻实际上非常清楚地展示了计算机在当时文化中的地位。他们令人兴奋，这具有新闻价值，但实际上，我是出于好奇才去那里的。计算机是一种新的、奇异的东西，它隐隐约约地威胁着当时绝大多数人甚至不会有意识地关注过的东西。事实上，那时，我的父母会带着他们的朋友来到我的卧室或黑客空间，只是为了惊叹于计算机的景象，而不是像 20 多岁的人惊叹于飞机从头顶飞过的景象一样。我喜欢的是现在这些人都沉迷于 iPad。

I think the interviewer talking about computers invading our homes is incredibly revealing. I didn't have to be very astute at that age to realize that the problem was that he was scared of computers and the change that it represents. That's my attempt to make a scary BBC Micro roaring. I found that really weird at the time. How could anyone be scared of computers? They were self-evidently wonderful, fulfilling things. Since then, I've worked for many organizations that face threatening existential change, and discovered that for many individuals within those organizations, the best strategy faced with a catastrophic change is just to ignore it, and pretend it's not happening. For instance, at BT, I remember senior people who profess to believe that Voice over IP wouldn't be a threat to BT's core business, because customers, you, instinctively prefer the familiar reliable feel of a landline call. They believe that given a choice that's what people would choose. 我认为采访者谈论计算机入侵我们的家庭非常有启发性。在那个年纪，我不需要非常精明就能意识到问题在于他害怕计算机及其所代表的变化。这是我试图让 BBC Micro 发出可怕的咆哮声的尝试。我当时觉得这真的很奇怪。怎么会有人害怕电脑呢？不言而喻，它们都是美妙而充实的事情。从那时起，我在许多面临威胁性的生存变革的组织中工作，并发现对于这些组织中的许多人来说，面对灾难性变革的最佳策略就是忽略它，并假装它没有发生。例如，在 BT，我记得高层人士声称相信 IP 语音不会对 BT 的核心业务构成威胁，因为客户（即您）本能地更喜欢固定电话的熟悉可靠感觉。他们相信，只要有选择，人们就会做出选择。

Let's go back to 1983 and see how Jeremy responds to this impertinence. 让我们回到 1983 年，看看杰里米如何回应这种无礼行为。

Interviewer: Jeremy, first of all, how did you become hooked, and what's the fascination? 采访者：Jeremy，首先，你是怎么迷上这个东西的，迷恋在哪里？

Ruston: I started off being interested in electronics and building radios and so on. Then I started building small computers. From then, I just started buying ready-built ones instead.Ruston：我一开始对电子产品和收音机等感兴趣。然后我开始建造小型计算机。从那时起，我就开始购买现成的。

Here indeed is that first computer. Its chief advantage was that it was 39 pounds 95 in kit form. Probably on this screen you can see my candid soldering. I don't know what that is. I was 12. Of course, it says there, only had 256 bytes of RAM. I don't think I ever filled that memory in my time with it. An astonishingly limited specification. As it says, no stack register. 这确实是第一台计算机。它的主要优点是套件重 39 磅 95 磅。也许在这个屏幕上你可以看到我坦率的焊接。我不知道那是什么。我当时 12 岁。当然，上面说，只有 256 字节的 RAM。我想我从来没有用它来填充过那段记忆。规格极其有限。正如它所说，没有堆栈寄存器。

It was like a RISC processor that had been cut in half, then cut in half again, and then cobbled together to work. Incredibly hard to convey how hard it was to use. It was about as much fun as programming a central heating controller. Our expectations of 256 bytes of RAM can be wrong. This is an image, it's an entry in a demo scene competition. The conditions of this competition are to write a MS-DOS XE in 256 bytes. That image is a 20 kilobyte JPEG generated by 256 bytes. How can 256 bytes contain an image as rich and complex as that? An astonishing achievement, but an extraordinary commonplace achievement today. What if I told you that actually, if you run this code, let's see what happens. This is actually animated. To me, it's stunning that in the amount of space that I might allocate to a comment at the top of a file, somebody can build an entire immersive world. I think that is in the category of impossible things that we need to believe before breakfast. 它就像一个 RISC 处理器被切成两半，然后再切成两半，然后拼凑在一起工作。很难形容它的使用有多么困难。这与对中央供暖控制器进行编程一样有趣。我们对 256 字节 RAM 的期望可能是错误的。这是一张图片，是演示场景竞赛的参赛作品。本次比赛的条件是写一个 256 字节的 MS-DOS XE。该图像是由 256 字节生成的 20 KB JPEG。 256 字节怎么能包含如此丰富和复杂的图像呢？这是一项令人震惊的成就，但在今天却是一项非凡的、平凡的成就。如果我告诉你，实际上，如果你运行这段代码，让我们看看会发生什么。这实际上是动画。对我来说，令人惊叹的是，在我为文件顶部的评论分配的空间量中，有人可以构建一个完整的沉浸式世界。我认为这是我们在早餐前需要相信的不可能的事情。

## The Role of Computer Magazines, in the '80s 八十年代计算机杂志的作用

Going back to the '80s, in the absence of the internet, the home computer community primarily manifested itself through computer magazines, and there were a lot of them, and they were a big business. A weird thing is, besides providing a substrate for the community, computer magazines were also a software distribution mechanism. They were stuffed full of listings of programs that people were expected to type in for themselves. 回到八十年代，在没有互联网的情况下，家庭电脑社区主要通过电脑杂志表现出来，而且数量很多，而且是一门大生意。奇怪的是，除了为社区提供基础之外，计算机杂志也是一种软件分发机制。它们塞满了人们需要自己输入的程序列表。

I soon started sending them in because they got published. It was, at the time, quite easy to figure out what people liked and send in this code. It was my first experience of what happens in a community, and today working in open source to see the same thing. It's the cycle of copying from other people, modifying what they've done, sharing it within the community, typically within a platform. It's weird to me that my first experience of that community was built on a substrate of old media, magazines, and books, and so on. It was still the same process that we see today. 我很快就开始将它们发送出去，因为它们已经出版了。当时，很容易弄清楚人们喜欢什么并在这段代码中发送。这是我第一次体验社区中发生的事情，今天在开源领域工作也看到了同样的事情。这是复制其他人所做的事情、修改他们所做的事情、在社区内（通常是在平台内）分享的循环。对我来说很奇怪的是，我对该社区的第一次体验是建立在旧媒体、杂志和书籍等基础上的。这仍然是我们今天看到的相同过程。

That was the context for me when the BBC Micro appeared, fresh from using a machine with 256 bytes of RAM. The photo I showed at the beginning was the front of the machine, but in fact, the underneath and the back are far more relevant to our discussion. You can see a large array of ports on the back and the front, mysterious ports, but easier to see on the schematic. The BBC Micro arrived with a very detailed manual, this included circuit diagrams of the connectors, which makes me laugh to think of the iPhone coming with a circuit diagram. 当 BBC Micro 出现时，这就是我的背景，刚刚使用过 256 字节 RAM 的机器。我一开始展示的照片是机器的正面，但事实上，底部和背面与我们的讨论更相关。您可以在背面和正面看到大量端口，这些端口很神秘，但在原理图上更容易看到。 BBC Micro 附带了一份非常详细的手册，其中包括连接器的电路图，这让我想起 iPhone 附带的电路图。

You can see there's a stunning array of ports, ones that you would expect, like a cassette interface. Also, a networking interface, in 1981 was for us, I know, one of the first networkable home computers. It had a video output that you could connect to your television. Indeed, the videos that you're seeing today were recorded on VHS like that. It also had a digital RGB output. Underneath, you can see parallel interfaces for disk, printer, and unassigned user ports that could be used for a variety of things. 您可以看到有一系列令人惊叹的端口，这些端口都是您所期望的，例如盒式磁带接口。另外，据我所知，1981 年的网络接口是我们第一批可联网的家用计算机之一。它有一个视频输出，可以连接到电视。事实上，你今天看到的视频就是这样用 VHS 录制的。它还具有数字 RGB 输出。在下面，您可以看到磁盘、打印机的并行接口和可用于多种用途的未分配的用户端口。

I jumped in and enjoyed all of that, and made my way from sending programs to magazines to writing books. Books at the time were also a software distribution mechanism. We tried to do the same things with software but we had to make do with the media at the time. I think these books today would just be a YouTube channel. Kids today do that kind of thing, or probably a Discord server. We didn't have any choice. At the time, I was typing out these books on an electric typewriter with my mum proofreading them. 我投入其中并享受这一切，并从向杂志发送程序到写书。当时的书籍也是一种软件分发机制。我们尝试用软件做同样的事情，但当时我们不得不用媒体来凑合。我认为今天的这些书只是 YouTube 频道。今天的孩子们会做这种事情，或者可能是 Discord 服务器。我们别无选择。当时，我正在用电动打字机打出这些书，妈妈正在校对它们。

It's also weird to think that home computers were so popular. The book, "The BBC Micro Revealed," actually made it into the Sunday Times top 10 bestseller list for a couple weeks, which is extraordinary for an incredibly arcane, confusing, very technical book. I think what happened was that a lot of parents were buying the BBC Micro for their kids in the belief that it would help educate them for the coming invasion of computers. They also picked up a copy of my book to reassure themselves that their child was going to be learning to program and not just playing games. Less gloriously, the book, "The BBC Micro Compendium," got me sued by Acorn. Several of the books were translated into other languages. It was actually really cool at the time to see the mechanism that the publishing industry, how quickly and efficiently they could do that. 家用电脑如此受欢迎也很奇怪。这本书《BBC Micro Revealed》实际上连续几周跻身《星期日泰晤士报》畅销书排行榜前十名，这对于一本令人难以置信的神秘、令人困惑且技术性很强的书来说是非同寻常的。我认为发生的事情是，很多家长为他们的孩子购买 BBC Micro，相信这有助于教育他们应对即将到来的计算机入侵。他们还拿起我的书，让自己放心，他们的孩子将学习编程，而不仅仅是玩游戏。不太光彩的是，《BBC Micro Compendium》这本书让我被 Acorn 起诉。其中几本书被翻译成其他语言。当时看到出版业的机制真的很酷，他们能够如此快速有效地做到这一点。

The book you see in the middle is an American edition of one of my books. Even that needed translation. I'd use the word clever. In the English sense, that was a clever thing to do, but that has a completely different connotation in North America. The translators quite rightly had changed it to the word smart, which I would never use in that context. That experience underlined for me the way that unknowingly our own culture and geography can be a barrier to communication. We need to pay attention to that. I hopefully will try to show you why. 你在中间看到的这本书是我的一本书的美国版。即使这样也需要翻译。我会用聪明这个词。从英语的意义上来说，这是一件聪明的事情，但在北美却有完全不同的含义。译者非常正确地把它改成了 “聪明” 这个词，我永远不会在这种情况下使用这个词。那次经历让我意识到，我们自己的文化和地理可能会在不知不觉中成为沟通的障碍。我们需要注意这一点。我希望能够向您展示原因。

## Collaboration in Open Source 开源协作

We see this idea in open source projects like TiddlyWiki. It has, like many open source projects, a plugin mechanism. We have a common substrate, a universal core. Plugins are our mechanism for people to accommodate people's sometimes conflicting requirements. We've architected it deliberately to be translatable. What you can see here is what happens as I work on TiddlyWiki. I'll merge a PR, that might include a change to the English translation. Then, within an hour or two, BramChen will submit a PR with matching changes for the Chinese translation. It's by far the highest quality translation we have and the most up to date. 我们在 TiddlyWiki 等开源项目中看到了这个想法。与许多开源项目一样，它具有插件机制。我们有一个共同的基板，一个通用的核心。插件是我们为人们提供的机制，可以满足人们有时相互冲突的需求。我们特意将其构建为可翻译的。您在这里可以看到我在 TiddlyWiki 上工作时发生的情况。我将合并一个 PR，其中可能包括对英文翻译的更改。然后，在一两个小时内，BramChen 将提交一份 PR，其中包含中文翻译的匹配更改。这是迄今为止我们拥有的最高质量且最新的翻译。

Quite often, he'll point out errors in what I've done or inconsistencies. As you can see, this has been going on for 10 years. I've had a 10-year relationship with Bram, but I've never met him. We can't really communicate except in Google Translate mediated broken English, and of course through the code. The privilege for me is that I feel I have these talented people looking over my shoulder helping me with my work. I feel as though I, like a lot of us here, are participating in a completely new way of working, that we're going to see more of in the future. 很多时候，他会指出我所做的事情中的错误或不一致之处。如您所见，这种情况已经持续了 10 年。我和布拉姆交往了十年，但我从未见过他。除了通过谷歌翻译蹩脚的英语，当然还有通过代码，我们无法真正进行交流。对我来说，荣幸的是我觉得有这些才华横溢的人在我的身后帮助我完成工作。我觉得我和我们这里的很多人一样，正在参与一种全新的工作方式，我们将来会看到更多这种方式。

It simply couldn't have happened just a few decades ago, the idea of collaborating so closely with somebody on the other side of the world. In fact, the Chinese community of TiddlyWiki is interesting in other ways too. The first thing is, it's huge. It's based on Chinese message boards, and an ecosystem of tools that I can't really see. It's like dark matter, this community that I can't see directly, but I know about it from the members of that community who also participate in the English language community. Indeed, there is a small group of Chinese developers, who are incredibly prolific and valued contributors to the project. What it means to me is that I haven't accidentally made a piece of software that represents me. I haven't accidentally made a piece of software that embodies the thinking of a middle-aged white man. I have actually achieved the goal of making something that's universal enough to be used by people of any culture. I think that is important for all of us in our work. 与世界另一端的人如此密切合作的想法在几十年前根本不可能发生。事实上，TiddlyWiki 中文社区在其他方面也很有趣。首先，它很大。它基于中文留言板，以及我无法真正看到的工具生态系统。就像暗物质一样，这个社区我无法直接看到，但我从该社区的成员那里知道了它，他们也参与了英语社区。事实上，有一小群中国开发者，他们是该项目的多产且有价值的贡献者。这对我来说意味着我并没有无意中制作了一款代表我的软件。我无意中制作了一款体现中年白人思维的软件。我实际上已经实现了制作足够通用的东西以供任何文化背景的人使用的目标。我认为这对我们所有人的工作都很重要。

## Understanding the Inside of a Machine (BBC Micro)

What were those books about? I think this is the first bit of code I've shown. When I got the BBC Micro, I dived into it, trying to understand every aspect of the machine, such thing that would be impossible now. Nobody could understand the inwardness of an iPhone, there's just too much going on. It was possible for one brain to understand the entirety of the inside of the machine. I'm afraid a lot of that is gone now. At the time, I knew where every memory location, hardware register was for, and I knew how to blow up your monitor by freaking the video chip.

For me, I think the biggest impact of the BBC Micro was going from programming in machine code to an extremely at the time, advanced, sophisticated, elegant, basic language with a built-in assembler, so that I could still jump into the assembler when needed. I was fascinated by the way programs like BBC BASIC, were constructed by people with great skills, deep technical skills. They were using those skills to empower people with less deep technical skills to do the same thing. To me, that's the kind of magic, to take your skills and empower people with less skills to pull them up behind you.

We live in a world today that's riddled with software. Software is eating the world. Software is making the world. It's riddled with it. Dig into the ground, anywhere, all you'll find is software. Every type of business now has to be a software business. Software developers like us are in a unique position. We're the people that can not only understand this world built of software, but also, we know how to change it. That was me disassembling BBC BASIC. I did a lot of that. In fact, that's still going on today. You'll find the BBC Micro community, those members who will publish a new disassembly of some popular game from the '80s. It's a big event.

## TiddlyWiki in Use

Armed with what I'd learned by disassembling BBC BASIC, I went on to write many compilers and interpreters myself, and realized that's what I cared about, creating a tool that I could then watch other people build something with. Empowering them to do something that they couldn't do previously. I think you see a nice example here with TiddlyWiki. TiddlyWiki has wiki in the name, but it's not at all interested in the idea of being a single page that lots of people can edit. Although it can do that, if you configure it that way.

What it's really rooted in is a much more fundamental idea of wikis, which is that they elevate linking to be part of the punctuation of writing, as opposed to tools that require you to dive into a sub-dialog box, to set up a link. TiddlyWiki takes that further with a rich wikitext syntax, that can express complex interactive applications. The goal of that, the reason why we do it, creating yet another computer language, is to let domain experts create their own custom tools, rather than having to go through a cycle of trying to explain the unexplainable requirements to a developer, and then the feedback cycle that results.

Here, what we see is an example of TiddlyWiki being used by an American high school teacher to develop a custom application for teaching volleyball. I have no idea what it means. You click around and there's masses of it. Little tables of instructions, ways of tracking the progress of the students. The thing that's interesting to me about that is I don't believe this world at the moment has a viable business model for custom software for volleyball teachers.

There's no business there. How can we serve those people? We know that what we do is useful. We know that computers and software applied carefully can help jobs like that. We simply don't have a business model. To me, the best that we can do is this, is empower the people who have the domain skills to build their own software. We have to step around capitalism and focus on people's needs.

Another example is TiddlyWiki being used by the Anna Freud center. They're a London based charity that do training and resources for working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They train all the social workers and similar people around the country. The challenge for them is that they've got a team in London, who are highly skilled, experienced, and they know, based on evidence, what practices work when you're in that situation with troubled young people. Their approach is to build a manual telling people what to do.

The discovery very early on was they had a team in London put together a manual telling you what to do, and then you give it to the team in Dagenham. If the team in Dagenham see things in the manual that don't apply to them, they'll reject the whole thing, that it's not for me. What we do with TiddlyWiki at Anna Freud is build what they call a fractal manual where there's a central manual, where individual teams get their own version of the manual that adds and removes content to make it relevant for them.

Of course, that's easy. It's just a database query, put different stuff on a webpage. What's hard here is to build a model for doing that kind of task that these domain experts can do. I'm not designing a system for you to use, I'm designing a system for social workers to use, for people whose skills are in another area.

## Self-Education

Let's, with that, step back to 1983, and have another patronizing question from our interviewer.

Interviewer: It must be pretty difficult writing all these bestselling books, and trying to struggle with your A levels?

Ruston: Yes, it is issue, very difficult. I failed my A levels in the summer because of it.

Interviewer: Has it been worthwhile?

Ruston: Yes, very much so.

Of course, I wouldn't want to advertise the benefits of failing school. At the time, all I was interested in was computers. That was all I wanted to learn about. Back then, I didn't have any chance of learning about that at school. Instead, I learned from the community and hanging around foils, reading all the important academic textbooks at the time. Now, of course, it's never been easier for people to educate themselves. We saw earlier those ports on the BBC Micro, they gave rise to an ecosystem of hardware that was really fun. I think the barriers to entry for that market were quite small. We saw a lot of innovative strange hardware.

This is a very early graphics tablet, which I have put to good use, in some quite fun work again for the BBC. It was later in 1983, I think one of my favorite ever gigs, where I made a series of animations on the BBC Micro that we use with a voiceover to introduce Children's BBC TV shows. That was a wonderful job. I would slouch into BBC TV center in the morning and have a meeting with the head of presentation, and we'd decide together that the next animation would be a tin of sardines with a wiggly tail. Then I'd go back home, stay up all night with a pint glass of coffee, putting these animations together. Then slightly bleary eyed, take them into the BBC the following day, and press the spacebar at the operative time for the animations to flow. I was involved for a few years in this but ultimately replaced by a broom cupboard, of all things.

Watching these back now I think, actually, the best thing about them is the sound effects. I hadn't kept these obviously, and so I put out a Twitter alert and found that again, there's a community that we didn't know about of people who collect old British TV VHS tapes. I have managed to now scrape together about eight of them, but there were a lot more of them originally.

## Latency in Computing

I also wanted to briefly mention the late Joe Armstrong. We'd been working together on a book about TiddlyWiki, just about a year before he died, almost exactly 5 years ago. Joe had first gotten in touch with me back in 2011, having somehow become obsessed with TiddlyWiki. We stayed in touch regularly and collaborated on a conference talk. Then the book, which was sadly curtailed when Joe passed. It was actually very difficult to get Joe to talk about his own work. I didn't have at that time any experience of Erlang, but I was fascinated to learn more.

Every time I'd ask him a question, he would redirect it to some arcane intricacy of TiddlyWiki. You can still see his blog today, based on TiddlyWiki. Joe taught me the full implications of a really simple observation that I think really, we're all grappling with: latency matters. If you care about latency, you need to move computation to where it is needed. If you have separate bits of computation, the laws of physics pretty much mean that you're using the actor model. I think Joe's formalization of the actor model into Erlang to me was a formalization of the laws of physics that I found incredibly inspiring.

## BBC's Doctor Who (Game)

We'll go back to 1983.

Interviewer: Perhaps we could now take a look at your latest computer game which is called Doctor Who. How does this work? Is this sort of Pac-Man, isn't it?

Ruston: Yes. It's based on some of the ideas from Pac-Man, but it's a very long program. It's taken quite a long time to lay it off disk. Essentially, you're that little dot in the corner, and you're being chased by those worms who have now eaten me. That's the game.

The game I showed was described as being called Doctor Who, but in fact, it was a bit more than that, it was the BBC's first official computer game using their now cherished Doctor Who intellectual property. I don't think it was quite so prized at the time. You might think it was an eccentric decision to entrust a franchise like that to the hands of a 16-year-old, however precocious. I know we've got people from the BBC here, and I'm about to talk about how the BBC worked in 1983. I'm pretty confident it doesn't work like this anymore.

What actually happened is I'd co-written a book for BBC publications, first called, "The Book of Listings." Again, reminding us that a book was considered an efficient mechanism of software distribution at the time. Getting a book published means having lots of meetings. That's how the industry worked at the time. I remember being quite often in the BBC publications offices in Marylebone. Once I was there, anything could happen. The lesson I learned is that people are lazy. One day, I was in the office and somebody said, Jeremy, would you like to do some modeling?

I really thought they meant Plasticine or McCartney, but they actually meant this. I ended up on the box of the BBC's robotic Turtle addon. In that context, when they started exploring making a Doctor Who game, obviously, I was the logical choice. I was a massive Doctor Who fan, of course, still a child at the time. I was thrilled. I wasn't really a games player. My interest in games again was diving into the tour de force programming that I saw, and I wasn't that interested in playing games. I never got to meet any of the actors, of course, but did get to collaborate with the Radiophonic Workshop on the music and sound effects, and did go to a props warehouse, where I saw an enormous pile of Cybermen body parts being prepared for an explosion.

It's a coding conference, let's look at the code. A couple of interesting details, I mentioned before how it mixes assembly language and BASIC together. You might notice we essentially minified our own code back in the day. The game was not an unqualified success. I think it suffered from being made by a committee, and a committee of people who are inexperienced, didn't really know what they're doing. That's not the recipe for success. I hope I had an excuse being 17. Even though the game could have been so much better, it is actually still bringing great joy to people. There's a steady stream of YouTubers reviewing it, and they revel in its hapless terribleness. I particularly recommend this to French people who watch it who have a species of hysterics that is quite infectious.

## Jeremy's JavaScript Linguistic Serendipity Generator

Let's jump back to one last dip into that interview.

Interviewer: What are the practical applications really for home computers. What are the most useful things you can do with one in the home?

Ruston: I think the most useful thing really is word processing for writing letters and so on. Then, there are the less general applications like shopping lists. I use it for cataloging records and books.

I answer honestly that I use computers for cataloging books and records, and had in fact written more than one program for that task. Of course, I was far too distracted by the joys of programming to actually use it for its intended purpose. Instead, I'm going to talk about something that I think the interviewer would have firmly considered utterly impractical and stupid.

This gives me a chance to talk about AI and large language models which I know we'll all be expecting. What I'm actually going to show you is the smallest feasible language model. It's something that many of you will know. There's a Markov chain generator. I didn't know that at the time. It's a program I originally wrote for the BBC Micro. What you see here is a more recent JavaScript version that's on the web and you can play with. What it does, very familiar process. You give it a body of training data. It does some frequency calculations. Then it generates essentially random text that matches the same letter sequence distribution.

Let's see if we can give it a try. I've primed it with a list of all the tube stations in London. This is what I remember doing with it in the '80s. My friends and I found this hilarious. We've got a setting. We'll start with two letters. It chooses the first two letters of the output text, and then chooses the next letter based on the frequency of all the different letters in the original text that follow those first two letters. Then it bumps along and does a bit more. There's two letters here. As it says, we get near gibberish, but recognizably, English, and some of them if you weren't from London, you might think could be a plausible tube station name.

If we crank it up to three letters, get slightly more plausible gibberish. I think South Greathrow is not bad. Hyde Parking Bridge. I'm not sure about Cockfoston, and so it goes. If we crank it up a little bit further, we get to confusingly readable where we'll see frequently, Farring Broadway. We were 17. This stuff is funny, but we really found it hilarious. I think the reason why we found it so funny, is interesting and relevant to where we are now. I think it's because our brains are desperate to find meaning. We're sense making machines.

We bring in sensors to our brain, and then our brain makes a story to ourselves about what it's seen. What this thing shows us is that our brains are so desperate to find meaning that we're like somebody, a narc for a con artist. We're perfectly primed to see intelligence and meaning where there is none. The fact that it's so easy to see meaning in a simple statistical trick like this proves how our brains make us vulnerable.

## The Purpose of Life

We are going to have one last dip into the 1980s. I worked with Richard Dawkins, who at the time was famous as the author of, "The Selfish Gene." We worked together on the graphics for a couple of BBC Horizon documentaries. I worked with him on these illustrative animations. They also let me make the end credits, which again seems crazy.

Dawkins: There has to be an initial critical number, a critical mass of \[inaudible 00:33:41] that have to get together before they can take off in the evolutionary sense. \[inaudible 00:33:48] chance of cooperation.

Ruston: Once again, digging through this old stuff, something I find amazing is that that 8-bit pixelated aesthetic was so mainstream, and that plinky-plonky music, extraordinary. Working with Dawkins did have a huge impact on me. In the years before as a teenager, I'd become what I today you might call a techno-utopian optimist, which has negative connotations to me, priding myself on my rationality.

I was obsessively worried, wondering about the meaning of life. We all are at that age. By the time I met Dawkins, I'd pretty much convinced myself that he was right, that the purpose of life is to pass on your genes. Dawkins was very kind and generous with his time and I learned a lot from him. What I actually learned, what I actually became convinced of is, there's a lot more to human life than passing on our genes. I learned a lesson that I find still guides me every day. It's this, it's surely that if life has a purpose, it is to love and be loved.

I think we need to ground ourselves on that perspective if we're to realize the potential of global collaboration. The fact is we find ourselves working alongside people sometimes who take different sides in a bitterly contested argument. Only love, compassion, and understanding will get us through. We can think that we're in the technology business, but actually, there's the people business. People work together best through love.
